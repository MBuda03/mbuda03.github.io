## Installation
There exist several ways of installing Umbraco such as installing and
configuring a webserver(e.g. IIS) and a database (e.g. SQL). In my opinion,
the easiest way to install Umbraco is to use [Webmatrix](http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/)

If you want to go with the Webmatrix method, just follow the installation
process, then, use the Webmatrix's app gallery which consists of several
open source projects such as Umbraco. Follow through the Webmatrix's installation
process until the end. In the end, webmatrix will open a new localhost site
which is the Umbraco's installation and configuration wizard if you are using
a version that is older than version 7, if it's version 7 or newer, it should
direct you to the websites administration panel after it finishes automatic
installation.
