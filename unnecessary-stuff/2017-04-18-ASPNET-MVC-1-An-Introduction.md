In these series, I will explore how MVC works, How ASP.NET Core works, compare it to ASP.NET then will deep into more detailed topics related to ASP.NET 5.

For these series, I will use Visual Studio 2015, however, as of now, Visual Studio Community edition 2017 is released which you can download from [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)


## Description of MVC
"ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoable, agile development." - www.asp.net/mvc

- Model -> Data
- View -> User Interface
- Controller -> Processing


## Understanding ASP.NET Core
"ASP.NET Core is a lean framework for building web and cloud applications. It is fully open source and available on GitHub." - www.asp.net/vnext

ASP.NET Core was originally called ASP.NET 5 however since it's built from scratch it is now known as ASP.NET Core.

- It can utilize .NET Core 1.0 (lightweight)
- Cross-platform development
- Host on IIS or own process
- Open-source and community focused
- Newer with strong investment
